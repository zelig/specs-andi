Handshake protocol is the protocol that is always run after two peers
are connected and before any other protocols are established. It
communicated information about peer \texttt{Overlay} address, network
\texttt{ID} and light node capability.

%The bzz handshake protocol is the protocol that is always run after two peers are connected and before any other protocols are established. It communicates information about peer \texttt{Overlay} address, network \texttt{ID}, and light node capability.

The handshake protocol defines only one stream:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ID: \texttt{/swarm/handshake/1.0.0/handshake} 
    \item Serialization: Varint delimited Protobuf
\end{itemize}

This message sequence is inspired by the TCP three way handshake to ensure message deliverability.

Upon connection a requesting peer constructs a new handshake stream and sends a \lstinline{Syn} message with its \lstinline{Overlay} address, \lstinline{Network ID} and \lstinline{Lightnode} capability flag, and waits for \lstinline{SynAck} response message from the responding peer. It then
sends its own \texttt{Syn} information and also \texttt{Ack} with the
received \texttt{Overlay} address for confirmation by the requesting
peer. After the requesting peer receives the \texttt{SynAck} message
from the responding peer and validates that the received \texttt{Ack}
information in it is correct, it sends the \texttt{Ack} message as a
confirmation to the responding peer. The stream is closed by the
responding peer after it receives the \texttt{Ack} message. If network
IDs are not the same between to peers, the connection must be terminated
during the \texttt{Syn\ -\ SynAck} exchange. Connection must be
terminated if the handshake is performed between two peers multiple
times over the same connection.

%In  the  \lstinline{SynAck} message responder sends it own \lstinline{Syn} message as well as an acknowledgement with the received Overlay address. After the requesting peer receives the \lstinline{SynAck} message from the responding peer and validates that the received \lstinline{Ack} information in it is correct, it sends an \lstinline{Ack} message itself as a confirmation to the responding peer. The stream is closed by the responding peer after it receives the \lstinline{Ack} message.

%The connection must be terminated if network IDs are do not match or if the  exact  order of messages is not followed.

%The bzz address is verified and overlay, underlay and signature are extracted.
%light is a boolean field indicating whether the node is operating as a light (as opposed to full) node.

%After the handshake,  each peer should remember the following data about the other:

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item the overlay address - used in forwarding  (see  \ref{spec:strategy:forwarding}),
%    \item the underlay address - used for dialing, passed to the underlay network protocol when the connectivity driver needs to connect to the peer (see \ref{spec:strategy:connection}),
%    \item the bzz address signature - needed by the hive protocol to pass information about the node to other peers (see \ref{spec:protocol:hive}),
%    \item whether the peer is a light node.
%\end{itemize}
