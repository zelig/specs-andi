\toprule
\textsc{constant name}&\textsc{type}&\textsc{value}&\textsc{description}\\\midrule
\texttt{BZZ\_NETWORK\_ID} & \textit{uint64} & 0 & ID of the swarm network
\\
\texttt{PHASE\_LENGTH} & \textit{uint64} &  38& length of commit phase of the redistribution game round in number of blocks
\\
\texttt{ROUND\_LENGTH} & \textit{uint64} & 152 & length of one redistribution game round in number of blocks, fixed at $4$ times the $\mathtt{PHASE\_LENGTH}$
\\
\texttt{NODE\_RESERVE\_DEPTH} & \textit{uint8}&  23 & size requirement for client reserve capacity given in log number of chunks                               
\\
\texttt{SAMPLE\_DEPTH} & \textit{uint8} & 4 & base 2 log number of chunks in sample
\\
\texttt{MAX\_SAMPLE\_VALUE} & \textit{uint256} & $1.2844e+72$ & maximum value for last transformed address in reserve sample, i.e., $<{}1\%$ chance the sampled set size is below a fourth of the prescribed node reserve size.
\\  
\texttt{MINIMUM\_STAKE} & \textit{uint256} & 10 & minimum stake amount in BZZ to be redefined as minimum stake given in storage rent units
\\
\texttt{MIN\_STAKE\_AGE} & \textit{uint256} & 228 & minimum number of blocks stakers need to wait after update or creation for the stake to be useable. Defaults to one and a half rounds to prevent opportunistic manipulation of stake after a neighbourhood is selected.
\\% \texttt{PRICE\_SIGNAL\_COEFF} & \textit{uint64} &  & 
% \\
\texttt{PRICE\_2X\_ROUNDS} & \textit{uint64} & 64 & number of rounds it takes for the price to double in the presence of a consistent lowest degree signal of undersupply.
\\
\texttt{NHOOD\_PEER\_COUNT} & \textit{uint8} & 4 & minimum number of nodes required to form a fully connected neighbourhood.
